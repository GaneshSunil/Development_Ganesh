        <li>Start by creating groups in which you will organize your samples</li>
        <li>For each group, select one or more samples (we strongly recommend you select at least 3 samples per group for best results)</li>
        <li>You will need at least two (2) groups</li>
        <li>Once your groups are ready, click the tab "Comparison Setup"</li>
        <li>Select how you want your groups to be compared</li>
        <li>The system will let you know if the analysis is ready to be launched. If errors are detected, the "Start" button will be disabled</li>
        <li>Common errors are:
        <ul>

            <li>A group does not have enough samples associated</li>
            <li>The groups have not been set up properly to be compared between each other</li>
